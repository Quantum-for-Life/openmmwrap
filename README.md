# openmmwrap
Wrapper utilities for OpenMM and OpenFF, including handy executables to:
* Prepare a system for productive MD simulations (including the parametrization of small-molecule force fields with OpenFF).
* Energy-minimize a system.
* Equilibrate a system in either the NVT or NPT ensemble, and perform a productive MD run.
* Analyze the trajectories resulting from the equilibrations and the productive runs.
  
## In progress
* Adding plotting utilities.
* Writing documentation (with Sphinx, to be added to ReadTheDocs).
* Writing small tutorials.
