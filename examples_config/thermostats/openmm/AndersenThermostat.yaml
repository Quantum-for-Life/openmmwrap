# Example of configuration for OpenMM's 'AndersenThermostat'.

# You may copy this configuration into the configuration
# files used with the 'openmm-run' executable and modify it
# as you see fit.

# The options listed in the 'options' sections are the
# same ones that can be passed to the 'openmmwrap.mdutil.
# thermostats.get_thermostat' function to set the thermostat
# via openmmwrap's API.

# You can find the documentation for the thermostat here:
# http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/
# openmm.openmm.AndersenThermostat.html

# The configuration for the thermostat
thermostat:

  # The name of the thermostat
  name: AndersenThermostat

  # Where the thermostat comes from. In this case,
  # it is a thermostat from 'openmm'
  is_from: openmm

  # The options that can be used to set up
  # the thermostat
  options:

    #----------------------- Required settings -----------------------#

    # The temperature of the heat bath (in Kelvin)
    temperature: 298

    # The collision frequency (in inverse picoseconds)
    collision_frequency: 100

    #----------------------- Optional settings -----------------------#

    # The force group this Force belongs to (supported values are
    # integers between 0 and 31, or None)
    force_group: !!null

    # The seed to be used for random numbers generation.
    # The precise meaning of this parameter is undefined,
    # and is left up to each platform to interpret in an
    # appropriate way. It is guaranteed that if two simulations
    # are run with different random number seeds, the sequence
    # of random forces will be different. On the other hand,
    # no guarantees are made about the behavior of simulations
    # that use the same seed. In particular, platforms are
    # permitted to use non-deterministic algorithms, which
    # produce different results on successive runs, even
    # if those runs were initialized identically. If the seed
    # is set to 0 (which is the default value assigned), a
    # unique seed is chosen when a 'Context' is created from
    # this 'Force'. This is done to ensure that each 'Context'
    # receives unique random seeds without you needing to
    # set them explicitly (from OpenMM's documentation)
    random_number_seed: !!null
