#---------------------------- Force field ----------------------------#


# Force field's options
force_field:

  # Fixed force fields
  fixed: ["amber99sbildn.xml", "tip3p.xml"]

  # Force field to be used to parametrize unknown molecules
  param: gaff-2.11


#----------------------------- Solvation -----------------------------#


# Solvation options (passed to the
# 'simtk.openmm.app.modeller.Modeller.addSolvent' method)
solvation:

  # Water model to be used
  model: tip3p

  # Shape of the solvation box to be used
  boxShape: dodecahedron

  # Padding to be used when building the box
  # (nm)
  padding: 1.2

  # Whether to neutralize the total charge
  # of the system
  neutralize: True

  # The total concentration of ions to add (apart
  # from those added to neutralize the system, if
  # neutralization was enabled) (mol/L)
  ionicStrength: 0.15

  # Which positive ion to use
  positiveIon: Na+

  # Which negative ion to use
  negativeIon: Cl-


#-------------------------- System creation --------------------------#


# Options used for the creation of the system (passed to the
# 'simtk.openmm.app.modeller.forcefield.ForceField' method)
system:

  # Which method to use for non-bonded interactions
  nonbondedMethod: PME

  # Which cut-off to use for non-bonded interactions (nm)
  nonbondedCutoff: 1.1

  # The bonds and angles that should be implemented as
  # constraints
  constraints: HBonds

  # Whether to keep the water molecules rigid - set it
  # to 'True' since the water model is 'tip3p'
  rigidWater: True
