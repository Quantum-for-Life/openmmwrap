# Example of configuration for OpenMM's 'NoseHooverIntegrator'.

# You may copy this configuration into the configuration
# files used with the 'openmm-run' executable and modify it
# as you see fit.

# The options listed in the 'options' sections are the
# same ones that can be passed to the 'openmmwrap.mdutil.
# integrators.get_integrator' function to set the integrator
# via openmmwrap's API.

# You can find the documentation for the integrator here:
# http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/
# openmm.openmm.NoseHooverIntegrator.html

# The configuration for the integrator
integrator:

  # The name of the integrator
  name: NoseHooverIntegrator

  # Where the integrator comes from. In this case,
  # it is an integrator from 'openmm'
  is_from: openmm

  # The options that can be used to set up 
  # the integrator
  options:

    #----------------------- Required settings -----------------------#

    # The size of each time step (in picoseconds)
    step_size: 0.001

    #----------------------- Optional settings -----------------------#

    # The thermostat(s) regulating the system's temperature.

    # To define one thermostat for the entire system, add only
    # thermostat named 'full_system'.

    # You can define multiple thermostats for different portions
    # of the system. The thermostats can have arbitrary names.

    # The thermostats for these portions of the system should define,
    # in addition to the same required settings of a full-system
    # thermostat:
    # - A 'thermostated_particles' option, defining the integer IDs
    #   of the particles to be thermostated.
    # - Optionally, a 'thermostated_pairs' option, defining a list
    #   of pairs of connected atoms (identified by their integer IDs)
    #   whose absolute center of mass motion and motion relative to
    #   one another will be independently thermostated.
    thermostats:

      # The thermostat for the entire system

        # The frequency of the interaction with the heat bath
        # (in inverse picoseconds)
        collision_frequency: 100

        #--------------- Optional thermostat settings ----------------#

        # The number of beads in the Nose-Hoover chain
