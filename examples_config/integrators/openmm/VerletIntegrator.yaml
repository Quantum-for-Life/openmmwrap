# Example of configuration for OpenMM's 'VerletIntegrator'.

# You may copy this configuration into the configuration
# files used with the 'openmm-run' executable and modify it
# as you see fit.

# The options listed in the 'options' sections are the
# same ones that can be passed to the 'openmmwrap.mdutil.
# integrators.get_integrator' function to set the integrator
# via openmmwrap's API.

# You can find the documentation for the integrator here:
# http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/
# openmm.openmm.VerletIntegrator.html

# The configuration for the integrator
integrator:

  # The name of the integrator
  name: VerletIntegrator

  # Where the integrator comes from. In this case,
  # it is an integrator from 'openmm'
  is_from: openmm

  # The options that can be used to set up
  # the integrator
  options:

    #----------------------- Required settings -----------------------#

    # The size of each time step (in picoseconds)
    step_size: 0.001

    #----------------------- Optional settings -----------------------#

    # The distance tolerance within which constraints are
    # maintained, as a fraction of the constrained distance
    constraint_tolerance: !!null
    
    # Which force groups to use for integration. By default,
    # all force groups are included. The groups are defined as
    # a set of indices for which force groups to include when
    # integrating the equations of motion. Alternatively, the
    # groups can be passed as a single unsigned integer
    # interpreted as a bitmask, in which case group 'i' will
    # be included if (groups & (1<<i)) != 0
    integration_force_groups: !!null
